  abstract =     "Sound and complete axiomatizations are provided for a
                 number of different logics involving modalities for
                 knowledge and time. These logics arise from different
                 choices for various parameters. All the logics
                 considered involve the discrete time linear temporal
                 logic operators `next' and `until' and an operator for
                 the knowledge of each of a number of agents. Both the
                 single agent and multiple agent cases are studied: in
                 some instances of the latter there is also an operator
                 for the common knowledge of the group of all agents.
                 Four different semantic properties of agents are
                 considered: whether they have a unique initial state,
                 whether they operate synchronously, whether they have
                 perfect recall, and whether they learn. The property of
                 no learning is essentially dual to perfect recall. Not
                 all settings of these parameters lead to recursively
                 axiomatizable logics, but sound and complete
                 axiomatizations are presented for all the ones that
                 do.",
