ABSTRACT = {This report contains the preliminary versions of papers presented at the Inte
rnational Conference on Advances in Modal Logic held in September 2004 in Manchester. The
 papers include 6 contributions by invited speakers and 28 accepted regular papers. These
 cover a wide range of topics in modal logic, extending from foundational papers on the m
athematics of modal logic, proof theory, computational aspects, philosophical issues, to
more `applied' research where extended modal logic formalisms and modelling of knowledge,
 belief, time and actions are crucial.}
